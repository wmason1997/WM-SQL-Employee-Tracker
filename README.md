## Description <a name="description"></a> 
I have created a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Video Example Walkthrough <a name="video-example-walkthrough"></a>
Here is a link to the video example walkthrough hosted on Google Drive: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/18aLOWyxOAfR6U_rpMSjb_gA6JiBSm2hi/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18aLOWyxOAfR6U_rpMSjb_gA6JiBSm2hi/view). I showed the interaction with the command line interface (CLI) by entering "node index.js"

## Installation <a name="installation-instructions"></a>
Clone this repository, install Inquirer@8.2.4, MySQL2, and run node index.js in the terminal.

## Usage <a name="usage-instructions"></a>
Run node index.js in the terminal.

## Credits <a name="credits"></a>
I used the Stu_Mini-Project from Module 12-SQL of the [UCSD-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2023-U-LOLC](https://git.bootcampcontent.com/University-of-California---San-Diego/UCSD-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2023-U-LOLC) GitLab repository as an example. Thank you, user mvpache!

I had a tutoring session with Mila Hose on 01/03/2023. Mila helped me to write Add Department, Role, and Employee functionality. The asynchronous function calls became invaluable for the nested Inquirer questions and SQL queries. Thanks, Mila!

I used ChatGPT for debugging when my code failed.
  
## Bonus <a name="bonus"></a>
I was able to get the delete department, delete role, and delete functionality working as well as the view all employees by department feature. I had trouble and was not able to finish the view by manager, update employee manager, and calculating department salary functionality as of yet.
